# 🚀 Fuel of Sol
Welcome to my **first Solana program** deployed on Devnet!  
This marks the beginning of my journey building decentralized, modular, and cinematic experiences on Solana.

## 📖 About
This program is a **starter experiment** on Solana smart contracts.  
It’s designed to help me:
- Understand Solana program deployment
- Explore account management
- Build confidence for bigger decentralized projects

## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd fuel-of-sol
cargo build-bpf

solana program deploy target/deploy/fuel_of_sol.so
🎯 Vision
This is just the first step. Future iterations will include:

Modular smart contract patterns

Recruiter‑grade polish in UI/UX

Cohort‑ready decentralized tools
